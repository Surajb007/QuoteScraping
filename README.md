# QuoteScraping

This projects scrapes all the quotes that are available on http://quotes.toscrape.com/ and stores into a csv file.

Later all the quotes which are scrapped from the website will be used in a guessing game, where a user needs to guess the author of a particular quote.
This game repeats until the user presses 'n'

To run this project:
1. Clone the project
2. Execute csv_scraper.py
3. Execute QuoteScraping.py
